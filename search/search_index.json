You can read more about AOGCMs and CMIP6 here . The datasets on this page have been developed by AdaptWest, a project funded by the Wilburforce Foundation to develop information resources for climate adaptation planning. The data were generated using the ClimateNA software. ClimateNA uses data from PRISM and WorldClim for current climate, and downscales data from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) database corresponding to the 6 th IPCC Assessment Report for future projections. Ensemble projections are average projections from 13 CMIP5 models (table below) that were chosen to represent all major clusters of similar AOGCMs. In addition to the ensemble projections, data are also provided from 9 individual AOGCMs (table below) that are representative of the larger ensemble. Nine individual models were selected to represent all major clusters of similar AOGCMs. A broader set of 13 AOGCMs were used to create the ensemble data. Ensemble projections are also provided here for a greater range of time periods and scenarios than are the projections from individual AOGCMs. AOGCM Ensemble Models AOGCM Individual Models ACCESS-ESM1-5 ACCESS-ESM1-5 BCC-CSM2-MR CNRM-ESM2-1 CNRM-ESM2-1 CanESM5 EC-Earth3 EC-Earth3 GFDL-ESM4 GFDL-ESM4 GISS-E2-1-G GISS-E2-1-G INM-CM5-0 IPSL-CM6A-LR MIROC6 MIROC6 MPI-ESM1-2-HR MPI-ESM1-2-HR MRI-ESM2-0 MRI-ESM2-0 UKESM1-0-LL UKESM1-0-LL Data citation \u00b6 AdaptWest Project. 2021.

ClimateNA uses data from PRISM and WorldClim for current climate, and downscales data from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) database corresponding to the 6 th IPCC Assessment Report for future projections. Ensemble projections are average projections from 13 CMIP5 models (table below) that were chosen to represent all major clusters of similar AOGCMs. In addition to the ensemble projections, data are also provided from 9 individual AOGCMs (table below) that are representative of the larger ensemble. Nine individual models were selected to represent all major clusters of similar AOGCMs. A broader set of 13 AOGCMs were used to create the ensemble data.

These time-series land cover maps were produced from annual time-series of Landsat image composites, forest change information, and ancillary topographic and hydrologic data following the framework described in Hermosilla et al. (2022), which builds upon the approach introduced in Hermosilla et al. (2018). The methodological innovations included (i) a refined training pool derived from existing land cover products using airborne and spaceborne measures of forest structure; (ii) selection of training samples proportionally to the land cover distribution using a distance=weighted approach; and (iii) generation of regional classification models using a 150x150 km tiling system. Maps are post-processed using disturbance information to ensure logical class transitions over time using a Hidden Markov Model. Hidden Markov Models assess individual year class likelihoods to reduce variability and possible noise in year-on-year class assignments (for instances when class likelihoods are similar).

Among several equations to estimate PET, a FAO application of the Penman-Monteith equation (Allen et al. 1998), here referred as FAOPM, is currently widely considered as a standard method (Walter et al. 2000). The FAO introduced the definition of PET as the ET of a reference crop (ET0) under optimal conditions, having the characteristics of well-watered grass with an assumed height of 12 centimeters, a fixed surface resistance of 70 seconds per meter and an albedo of 0.23 (Allen et al. 1998).

The GEBCO_2021 Grid provides global coverage of elevation data in meters on a 15 arc-second grid of 43200 rows x 86400 columns, giving 3,732,480,000 data points. The GEBCO_2021 Grid is a continuous, global terrain model for ocean and land with a spatial resolution of 15 arc seconds. The grid uses as a \u2018base\u2019 Version 2 of the SRTM15+ data set (Tozer et al, 2019). This data set is a fusion of land topography with measured and estimated seafloor topography. It is augmented with the gridded bathymetric data sets developed by the four Seabed 2030 Regional Centers. The Regional Centers have compiled gridded bathymetric data sets, largely based on multibeam data, for their areas of responsibility. These regional grids were then provided to the Global Center. For areas outside of the polar regions (primarily south of 60\u00b0N and north of 50\u00b0S), these data sets are in the form of 'sparse grids', i.e. only grid cells that contain data were populated. For the polar regions, complete grids were provided due to the complexities of incorporating data held in polar coordinates. The compilation of the GEBCO_2021 Grid from these regional data grids was carried out at the Global Center, with the aim of producing a seamless global terrain model. The GEBCO_2021 Grid includes data sets from a number of international and national data repositories and regional mapping initiatives.

The Geomorpho90m variables are available at 3 (~90\u2009m) and 7.5 arc-second (~250\u2009m) resolutions under the WGS84 geodetic datum, and 100\u2009m spatial resolution under the Equi7 projection. They are useful for modelling applications in fields such as geomorphology, geology, hydrology, ecology and biogeography. Geomorpho90m is a set of geomorphometric variables derived from MERIT-DEM. The are available at 3 resolutions the ingested ones are the 3 arc-second (~90m) resolution.The layers can be downloaded from OpenTopography or from Google Drive .

Data are available in easily accessible GIS-layers and can also be explored online here and a detailed description of the underlying methodology is provided by Andela et al. (2019). The data provide unique insights in the environmental conditions that give rise to the world's most extreme wildfires. The world's largest wildfires were found in sparsely populated arid and semiarid grasslands and shrublands of interior Australia, Africa, and Central Asia. Strikingly, fires of these proportions were nearly absent in similar ecosystems of North and South America, possibly due to higher landscape fragmentation and different management practices, including active fire suppression. While the world's largest fires occurred in more arid ecosystems, the longest fires burned for over 2 months in seasonal regions of the humid tropics and high-latitude forests. In these sparsely populated high fuel-load systems fires can continuously burn as long as weather conditions are favorable. Abnormal weather conditions often synchronized the occurrence of multiple extreme wildfires across larger regions. Global patterns of fire velocity were reversely related to fuel loads, and the highest fire velocities typically occurred in areas of low fuel loads. Citation \u00b6 Andela, Niels, Douglas C.

Estimates of (1) mangrove aboveground biomass (AGB), (2) maximum canopy height (height of the tallest tree), and (3) basal-area weighted height (individual tree heights weighted in proportion to their basal area) for the nominal year 2000 were derived across a 30-meter resolution global mangrove ecotype extent map using remotely-sensed canopy height measurements and region-specific allometric models. Also provided are (4) in situ field measurement data for selected sites across a wide variety of forest structures (e.g., scrub, fringe, riverine and basin) in mangrove ecotypes of the global equatorial region. Within designated plots, selected trees were identified to species and diameter at breast height (DBH) and tree height was measured using a laser rangefinder or clinometer. Tree density (the number of stems) can be estimated for each plot and expressed per unit area. These data were used to derive plot-level allometry among AGB, basal area weighted height (Hba), and maximum canopy height (Hmax) and to validate the remotely sensed estimates. Spatially explicit maps of mangrove canopy height and AGB derived from space-borne remote sensing data and in situ measurements can be used to assess local-scale geophysical and environmental conditions that may regulate forest structure and carbon cycle dynamics.

The GRIP dataset consists of global and regional vector datasets in ESRI filegeodatabase and shapefile format, and global raster datasets of road density at a 5 arcminutes resolution (~8x8km). The GRIP dataset is mainly aimed at providing a roads dataset that is easily usable for scientific global environmental and biodiversity modelling projects.

However in any case we hope the lat long provides a more accurate representation of a site. Another thing to note is that the CSVs seemed to have been exported with the index column which is not very useful and especially since it was missing a header, so the index column was removed from all CSVs before being renamed and ingested.

Since site names included special characters like + or # or spaces which are not allowed in GEE naming convention we applied a consistent find and replace strategy to provide some level of consistency between locations. However in any case we hope the lat long provides a more accurate representation of a site. Another thing to note is that the CSVs seemed to have been exported with the index column which is not very useful and especially since it was missing a header, so the index column was removed from all CSVs before being renamed and ingested.

Remotely sensed observations can provide insights into historical urban dynamics, but only during the satellite era. Here, we develop a 1\u2009km resolution global dataset of annual urban dynamics between 1870 and 2100 using an urban cellular automata model trained on satellite observations of urban extent between 1992 and 2013. Hindcast (1870\u20131990) and projected (2020\u20132100) urban dynamics under the five Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) were modeled. We find that global urban growth under SSP5, the fossil-fuelled development scenario, was largest with a greater than 40-fold increase in urban extent since 1870. The high resolution dataset captures grid level urban sprawl over 200 years, which can provide insights into the urbanization life cycle of cities and help assess long-term environmental impacts of urbanization and human\u2013environment interactions at a global scale.

The Global Wind Atlas facilitates online queries and provides freely downloadable datasets based on the latest input data and modeling methodologies. Users can additionally download high-resolution maps of the wind resource potential, for use in GIS tools, at the global, country, and first-administrative unit (State/Province/Etc.) levels. You can read more about the methods used here The modeling process is made up of a WAsP calculation of local wind climates for every 250 m at five heights: 10 m; 50 m; 100 m; 150 m and; 200 m. On a 250 m grid, there is a local wind climate estimate for every node. Power density data takes into account geographical variations of air density. Includes variables in the Google Earth Engine collection include, wind speed, air density and power density. Surface roughness length is a property of the surface which can be used to determine the way the horizontal wind speed varies with height. The wind speed at a given height decreases with increasing surface roughness. Most of the data are named as follows: gwa_{variable}_{height}.tif with GEE collections, where variable is one of and this description below is obtained here wind-speed - The mean wind speed at the location for the 10 year period power-density - The mean power density of the wind, which is related to the cube of the wind speed, and can provide additional information about the strength of the wind not found in the mean wind speed alone. air-density - The air density is found by interpolating the air density from the CFSR reanalysis to the elevation used in the global wind atlas following the approach described in WAsP 12. RIX - The RIX (Ruggedness IndeX) is a measure of how complex the terrain is. It provides the percent of the area within 10 km of the position that have slopes over 30-degrees. A RIX value greater than 5 suggests that you should use caution when interpreting the results. The files which do not follow the naming convention above are the capacity-factor layers. The capacity factor layers were calculated for 3 distinct wind turbines, with 100m hub height and rotor diameters of 112, 126, and 136m, which fall into three IEC Classes (IEC1, IEC2, and IEC3). Capacity factors can be used to calculate a preliminary estimate of the energy yield of a wind turbine (in the MW range), when placed at a location. This can be done by multiplying the rated power of the wind turbine by the capacity factor for the location (and the number of hours in a year): AEP = P rated * CF * 8760 hr/year, where AEP is annual energy production, Prated is rated power, and CF is capacity factor.

This release has made it possible for FutureWater to update its HiHydroSoil v1.2 database with newer, more precise and with a higher resolution soil data, which resulted in the development and release of HiHydroSoil v2.0. Soil information is the basis for all environmental studies. Since local soil maps of good quality are often not available, global soil maps with a low resolution are used. Furthermore, soil maps do not include information about soil hydraulic properties, which are of importance in, for example, hydrological modeling, erosion assessment and crop yield modelling. HiHydroSoil v2.0 can fill this data gap. HiHydroSoil v2.0 includes the following data and additional information along with links to download the data can be found here Organic Matter Content Soil Texture Class Saturated Hydraulic Conductivity Mualem van Genuchten parameters Alpha and N Saturated Water Content Residual Water Content Water content at pF2, pF3 and pF4.2 Hydrologic Soil Group (USDA) The Hydrologic Soil Group (HSG) determines the Runoff Curve Number which is often used in hydrological modelling to estimate the direct runoff from rainfall. Four hydrologic soil groups and three dual hydrologic soil groups.

However, global information is scarce and inconsistent across spatial scales and regions. Here we develop a geo-statistical model to estimate the volume of global lakes with a surface area of at least 10\u2009ha based on the surrounding terrain information. The HydroLAKES database was designed as a digital map repository to include all lakes with a surface area of at least 10 ha with a total surface area of 2.67 \u00d7 106\u2009km2 (1.8% of global land area), a total shoreline length of 7.2 \u00d7 106\u2009km (about four times longer than the world\u2019s ocean coastline) and a total volume of 181.9 \u00d7 103\u2009km3 (0.8% of total global non-frozen terrestrial water stocks). HydroLAKES aims to be as comprehensive and consistent as possible at a global scale and contains both freshwater and saline lakes, including the Caspian Sea, as well as human-made reservoirs and regulated lakes.

Country Country that the lake (or reservoir) is located in. International or transboundary lakes are assigned to the country in which its corresponding lake pour point is located and may be arbitrary for pour points that fall on country boundaries. Continent Continent that the lake (or reservoir) is located in. Geographic continent: Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, South America, or Oceania (Australia and Pacific Islands) Poly_src Source of original lake polygon: CanVec; SWBD; MODIS; NHD; ECRINS; GLWD; GRanD; or Other More information on these data sources can be found in Table 1. Lake_type Indicator for lake type: 1: Lake 2: Reservoir 3: Lake control (i.e. natural lake with regulation structure) Note that the default value for all water bodies is 1, and only those water bodies explicitly identified as other types (mostly based on information from the GRanD database) have other values; hence the type \u2018Lake\u2019 also includes all unidentified smaller human-made reservoirs and regulated lakes. Grand_id ID of the corresponding reservoir in the GRanD database, or value 0 for no corresponding GRanD record. This field can be used to join additional attributes from the GRanD database. Lake_area Lake surface area (i.e. polygon area), in square kilometers. Shore_len Length of shoreline (i.e. polygon outline), in kilometers. Shore_dev Shoreline development, measured as the ratio between shoreline length and the circumference of a circle with the same area. A lake with the shape of a perfect circle has a shoreline development of 1, while higher values indicate increasing shoreline complexity. Vol_total Total lake or reservoir volume, in million cubic meters (1 mcm = 0.001 km3). For most polygons, this value represents the total lake volume as estimated using the geostatistical modeling approach by Messager et al. (2016). However, where either a reported lake volume (for lakes \u2265 500 km2) or a reported reservoir volume (from GRanD database) existed, the total volume represents this reported value. In cases of regulated lakes, the total volume represents the larger value between reported reservoir and modeled or reported lake volume. Column \u2018Vol_src\u2019 provides additional information regarding these distinctions. Vol_res Reported reservoir volume, or storage volume of added lake regulation, in million cubic meters (1 mcm = 0.001 km3). 0: no reservoir volume Vol_src 1: \u2018Vol_total\u2019 is the reported total lake volume from literature 2: \u2018Vol_total\u2019 is the reported total reservoir volume from GRanD or literature 3: \u2018Vol_total\u2019 is the estimated total lake volume using the geostatistical modeling approach by Messager et al. (2016) Depth_avg Average lake depth, in meters. Average lake depth is defined as the ratio between total lake volume (\u2018Vol_total\u2019) and lake area (\u2018Lake_area\u2019). Dis_avg Average long-term discharge flowing through the lake, in cubic meters per second. This value is derived from modeled runoff and discharge estimates provided by the global hydrological model WaterGAP, downscaled to the 15 arc-second resolution of HydroSHEDS (see section 2.2 for more details) and is extracted at the location of the lake pour point. Note that these model estimates contain considerable uncertainty, in particular for very low flows. -9999: no data as lake pour point is not on HydroSHEDS landmask Res_time Average residence time of the lake water, in days. The average residence time is calculated as the ratio between total lake volume (\u2018Vol_total\u2019) and average long-term discharge (\u2018Dis_avg\u2019). Values below 0.1 are rounded up to 0.1 as shorter residence times seem implausible (and likely indicate model errors). -1: cannot be calculated as \u2018Dis_avg\u2019 is 0 -9999: no data as lake pour point is not on HydroSHEDS landmask Elevation Elevation of lake surface, in meters above sea level. This value was primarily derived from the EarthEnv-DEM90 digital elevation model at 90 m pixel resolution by calculating the majority pixel elevation found within the lake boundaries. To remove some artefacts inherent in this DEM for northern latitudes, all lake values that showed negative elevation for the area north of 60\u00b0N were substituted with results using the coarser GTOPO30 DEM of USGS at 1 km pixel resolution, which ensures land surfaces \u22650 in this region. Note that due to the remaining uncertainties in the EarthEnv-DEM90 some small negative values occur along the global ocean coastline south of 60\u00b0N which may or may not be correct. Slope_100 Average slope within a 100 meter buffer around the lake polygon, in degrees. This value is derived from the EarthEnv-DEM90 digital elevation model at 90 m pixel resolution. Slopes for each pixel were computed with latitudinal corrections for the distortion in the XY spacing of geographic coordinates by approximating the geodesic distance between cell centers. For 12 lakes located above the northern limit of the EarthEnv-DEM90 digital elevation model (83\u00b0N), slopes were computed from the GTOPO30 DEM of USGS at 1 km pixel resolution. -1: slope values were not calculated for the largest lakes (polygon area \u2265 500 km2) Wshd_area Area of the watershed associated with the lake, in square kilometers. The watershed area is calculated by deriving and measuring the upstream contribution area to the lake pour point using the HydroSHEDS drainage network map at 15 arc-second resolution. -9999: no data as lake pour point is not on HydroSHEDS landmask Pour_long Longitude of the lake pour point, in decimal degrees.

LANDFIRE (LF) layers are created using predictive landscape models based on extensive field-referenced data, satellite imagery and biophysical gradient layers using classification and regression trees. LF Remap is a comprehensive mapping effort that uses recent data to create a new base map product suite that better represents contemporary conditions. LF Remap represents circa 2016 ground conditions and is designed to produce vegetation, disturbance, and fuels products that inform wildland fire and ecological decision systems. LF Remap has improved past methodologies and processes to incorporate current satellite imagery, contemporary data sources, and the latest software and hardware technologies. Final LF Remap products offer significant improvements to all previous LF versions (read more about versions here https://www.landfire.gov/lf_schedule.php ). LF Remap products are designed to facilitate national and regional level strategic fire and resource management planning and reporting of management activities. The principal purposes of the products include providing, 1) national level, landscape scale geospatial products to support fire and fuels management planning, and 2) consistent fuels products to support fire planning, analysis, and budgeting to evaluate fire management alternatives. Products are created at a 30 meter raster; however, the applicability of products varies by location and specific use. LF products were designed to support 1) national (all states) strategic planning, 2) regional (single large states or groups of smaller states), and 3) strategic/tactical planning for large sub regional landscapes and Fire Management Units (FMUs) (such as significant portions of states or multiple federal administrative entities). The applicability of LF products to support fire and land management planning on smaller areas will vary by product, location, and specific use.

Land Cover Class Description Developed Areas of intensive use with much of the land covered with structures (e.g., high-density residential, commercial, industrial, mining, or transportation), or less intensive uses where the land cover matrix includes vegetation, bare ground, and structures (e.g., low-density residential, recreational facilities, cemeteries, transportation/utility corridors, etc.), including any land functionality related to the developed or built-up activity. Cropland Land in either a vegetated or unvegetated state used in production of food, fiber, and fuels. This includes cultivated and uncultivated croplands, hay lands, orchards, vineyards, and confined livestock operations. Forest plantations are considered as forests or woodlands (Tree Cover class) regardless of the use of the wood products. Grass/Shrub Land predominantly covered with shrubs and perennial or annual natural and domesticated grasses (e.g., pasture), forbs, or other forms of herbaceous vegetation. The grass and shrub cover must comprise at least 10% of the area and tree cover is less than 10% of the area. Tree Cover Tree-covered land where the tree cover density is greater than 10%. Cleared or harvested trees (i.e., clearcuts) will be mapped according to current cover (e.g., Barren, Grass/Shrub). Water Areas covered with water, such as streams, canals, lakes, reservoirs, bays, or oceans. Wetland Lands where water saturation is the determining factor in soil characteristics, vegetation types, and animal communities. Wetlands are composed of mosaics of water, bare soil, and herbaceous or wooded vegetated cover. Ice/Snow Land where accumulated snow and ice does not completely melt during the summer period (i.e., perennial ice/snow). Barren Land comprised of natural occurrences of soils, sand, or rocks where less than 10% of the area is vegetated.

Forest plantations are considered as forests or woodlands (Tree Cover class) regardless of the use of the wood products. Grass/Shrub Land predominantly covered with shrubs and perennial or annual natural and domesticated grasses (e.g., pasture), forbs, or other forms of herbaceous vegetation. The grass and shrub cover must comprise at least 10% of the area and tree cover is less than 10% of the area. Tree Cover Tree-covered land where the tree cover density is greater than 10%. Cleared or harvested trees (i.e., clearcuts) will be mapped according to current cover (e.g., Barren, Grass/Shrub). Water Areas covered with water, such as streams, canals, lakes, reservoirs, bays, or oceans. Wetland Lands where water saturation is the determining factor in soil characteristics, vegetation types, and animal communities. Wetlands are composed of mosaics of water, bare soil, and herbaceous or wooded vegetated cover. Ice/Snow Land where accumulated snow and ice does not completely melt during the summer period (i.e., perennial ice/snow). Barren Land comprised of natural occurrences of soils, sand, or rocks where less than 10% of the area is vegetated.","title":"LCMAP Level 1 Land Cover Classes"},{"location":"projects/lcmap/#citation","text":"There are no restrictions on the use of the LCMAP Reference Data Products.

This includes all fires 1000 acres or greater in the western United States and 500 acres or greater in the eastern Unites States.

The definition is drawn from the reference: NWCG Glossary of Wildland Fire Terms and is based on the term Fire Severity, which is defined as: \"Degree to which a site has been altered or disrupted by fire; loosely, a product of fire intensity and residence time.\" The following additional statements further clarify the nature of the products developed by this project: Burn severity is a composite of first-order effects and second order effects that arise within one growing season. Burn severity relates principally to visible changes in living and non-living biomass, fire byproducts (scorch, char, ash), and soil exposure. Burn severity occurs on a gradient or ordinal scale. Burn severity is a mosaic of effects that occur within a fire perimeter. Longer term effects are controlled by variables that evolve after a fire and are beyond the scope of this program.

The authors used data on waste management, population density, and hydrological information to create this model. The dataset includes information on 40,760 watersheds and 182 different countries. The data is presented in a vector format. Plastic pollution in our oceans and on our coastlines have become a major threat to ocean health worldwide. A better understanding and quantification of marine plastic sources can help in implementing mitigation strategies to alleviate the issue. The dataset can help in identifying places that require higher attention in terms of plastic waste monitoring and mitigation plans. This data can also be used as a baseline measurement for ocean plastic mass balance exercises. This data was developed by researchers funded by The Ocean Cleanup Foundation. Methodology \u00b6 The amount of plastic inputs from rivers into the oceans was estimated by using data on mismanaged plastic waste production (MPW) per country, population density, topographic elevation, and location of artificial barriers (weirs and dams). For each catchment area mismanaged plastic waste production (MPW) rates per day were calculated by combining data on waste generation by inhabitant per day and population density for the area. This data was combined with water flow per river catchment area to provide a final value for the mass of plastic released at the river\u2019s mouth. This data was extrapolated using seasonal variations in water flow to create a year dataset. Data on population density was derived from the dataset Global 15 x 15 Minute Grids of the Downscaled Population by the Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC) for 182 countries. Data used to calculate MPW rates were collected from seven peer reviewed studies. Topographic information was taken from Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) hydrological model for surface/subsurface runoff and location of artificial barriers was taken from AquaStat and Global Reservoir and Dam Database (GRanD). In total the dataset includes information for 40,760 watersheds worldwide. For the full documentation, please see the source methodology .

The authors used data on waste management, population density, and hydrological information to create this model. The dataset includes information on 40,760 watersheds and 182 different countries. The data is presented in a vector format. Plastic pollution in our oceans and on our coastlines have become a major threat to ocean health worldwide. A better understanding and quantification of marine plastic sources can help in implementing mitigation strategies to alleviate the issue. The dataset can help in identifying places that require higher attention in terms of plastic waste monitoring and mitigation plans. This data can also be used as a baseline measurement for ocean plastic mass balance exercises. This data was developed by researchers funded by The Ocean Cleanup Foundation.","title":"Plastic Inputs from Rivers into Oceans"},{"location":"projects/plastic/#methodology","text":"The amount of plastic inputs from rivers into the oceans was estimated by using data on mismanaged plastic waste production (MPW) per country, population density, topographic elevation, and location of artificial barriers (weirs and dams). For each catchment area mismanaged plastic waste production (MPW) rates per day were calculated by combining data on waste generation by inhabitant per day and population density for the area. This data was combined with water flow per river catchment area to provide a final value for the mass of plastic released at the river\u2019s mouth. This data was extrapolated using seasonal variations in water flow to create a year dataset. Data on population density was derived from the dataset Global 15 x 15 Minute Grids of the Downscaled Population by the Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC) for 182 countries. Data used to calculate MPW rates were collected from seven peer reviewed studies. Topographic information was taken from Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) hydrological model for surface/subsurface runoff and location of artificial barriers was taken from AquaStat and Global Reservoir and Dam Database (GRanD).

The estimates are produced at 30-meter spatial resolution for each year between 1984\u2013present. The six plant functional groups are Annual Forbs and Grasses, Perennial Forbs and Grasses, Shrubs, Trees, Litter, and Bare Ground. Cover values are reported as percentages on a pixel-by-pixel basis. The estimates were produced using a temporal convolutional network using field measures of plant functional groups collected by the Natural Resources Conservation Service Natural Resources Inventory (NRI) program, the Bureau of Land Management Assessment, Inventory, and Monitoring (AIM) program, and the National Park Service Northern Colorado Plateau Network (NCPN) alongside spatially continuous earth observations from Landsat TM, ETM+, and OLI Collection 2. Rangeland Production: : Rangeland Analysis Platform (RAP) Rangeland Production, version 3.0 consists of gridded estimates of herbaceous aboveground biomass, partitioned into vegetation types for annual forbs and grasses and perennial forbs and grasses. The estimates are produced at 30m spatial resolution from 1986-present. Estimates are provided annually and at 16-day intervals. Values are reported in terms of net primary productivity which can be converted to pounds per acre of new growth of aboveground biomass using the function in the Google Earth Engine script below\u2013 estimates do not reflect standing biomass from previous years. Estimates are calculated using a light use efficiency model (to estimate net primary production in terms of carbon) which is then allocated to aboveground and belowground pools (based on mean annual temperature) and further converted to biomass using a carbon-to-dry matter ratio.

The estimates are produced at 30-meter spatial resolution for each year between 1984\u2013present. The six plant functional groups are Annual Forbs and Grasses, Perennial Forbs and Grasses, Shrubs, Trees, Litter, and Bare Ground. Cover values are reported as percentages on a pixel-by-pixel basis. The estimates were produced using a temporal convolutional network using field measures of plant functional groups collected by the Natural Resources Conservation Service Natural Resources Inventory (NRI) program, the Bureau of Land Management Assessment, Inventory, and Monitoring (AIM) program, and the National Park Service Northern Colorado Plateau Network (NCPN) alongside spatially continuous earth observations from Landsat TM, ETM+, and OLI Collection 2. Rangeland Production: : Rangeland Analysis Platform (RAP) Rangeland Production, version 3.0 consists of gridded estimates of herbaceous aboveground biomass, partitioned into vegetation types for annual forbs and grasses and perennial forbs and grasses. The estimates are produced at 30m spatial resolution from 1986-present. Estimates are provided annually and at 16-day intervals. Values are reported in terms of net primary productivity which can be converted to pounds per acre of new growth of aboveground biomass using the function in the Google Earth Engine script below\u2013 estimates do not reflect standing biomass from previous years. Estimates are calculated using a light use efficiency model (to estimate net primary production in terms of carbon) which is then allocated to aboveground and belowground pools (based on mean annual temperature) and further converted to biomass using a carbon-to-dry matter ratio.

Dataset Record \u00b6 The VV and VH mosaics are sampled at 10 m pixel spacing, georeferenced to the Equi7Grid and divided into six continental zones (Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania, South America), which are further divided into square tiles of 100 km extent (\"T1\"-tiles). With this setup, the S1GBM consists of 16071 tiles over six continents, for VV and VH each, totaling to a compressed data volume of 2.67 TB. The files were distributed as aggregated zipfiles with a total of 12 zip files. The tiles' file-format is a LZW-compressed GeoTIFF holding 16-bit integer values, with tagged metadata on encoding and georeference.

It is being made public to act as supplementary data for the publication 'Large soil carbon storage in terrestrial ecosystems of Canada', currently under review. The maps were produced in the Remote Sensing Lab, McMaster University, between January and December 2020. This research project was made possible by a grant from the World Wildlife Fund (WWF)- Canada. This project aimed to produce the first wall-to-wall estimate of carbon stocks in plants and soils of Canada at 250 m spatial resolution using multisource satellite, climate and topographic data and a machine-learning algorithm. You can read the preprint of the paper here and download the datasets from collection here Dataset descriptors \u00b6 Canopy Height Map The canopy height maps were built to be included as covariates in the model to predict AGB (and carbon stock) in forest areas of Canada. We created wall-to-wall height metrics using ATL08 LiDAR products from the ICESat-2 satellite. The data was download for one-year period (October 2018 to October 2019). Points were filtered regarding solar background noise and atmospheric scattering, totaling 49,959 points distributed over the entire Canada. These points were associated with 10 ancillary variables primarily corresponding to structure information, such as seasonal Sentinel-1 VV and VH polarization, annual PALSAR-2 HH and HV polarization, annual clumping index, and also the MODIS NDVI summer season. Afterwards, the random forest algorithm was used to extrapolate ATL08 parameters and develop regression models with the abovementioned spatially continuous variables. Soil Carbon Concentration To generate the soil carbon concentration maps, we used 6,533 ground soil samples, long-term climate data, multisource remote sensing data, topografic information, soil type, depth, and a 3D random forest regression model. Forest Carbon This dataset contains the map with total carbon stored in plants of forested areas in Canada (AGB, BGB and dead plants) and carbon stock uncertainty. To estimate the carbon stored in plants of forest areas, we used 47,967 ground measurements of AGB and 58 covariates mainly composed of optical data, terrain parameters, structural parameters (e.g., SAR data, clump index, canopy heights \u2013 generated from satellite LiDAR- included in the other dataset), soil type map and radiation flux data. We used a random forest model for spatial prediction of AGB in forest areas while 1 st and 3 rd quantiles of RF quantile regression were used to build the uncertainty map. After generating the AGB map, the root biomass of forest areas was computed by its relationship to AGB according to forest type. The dead plant materials were computed by a linear regression between live and dead AGB defined with ground measurements. Ultimately, the AGB as well as dead plant materials and BGB were multiplied by 0.5 to provide the carbon maps. includes carbon stored in above and belowground biomass and dead plant materials Soil Carbon Stock Map To generate the soil carbon stock map, we used 6,490 ground samples of soil organic carbon concentration (g/kg) and 2,973 ground samples of bulk density (kg/dm3), long-term climate data, multisource remote sensing data, topografic information, soil type, depth, and a 3D random forest regression model. The uncertainty map was generated using the random forest quantile regression approach difference between 95 th and 5 th quantiles (90% confidence interval) of soil organic carbon and bulk density predictions.

Find the GitHub project and datasets here: https://github.com/teamookla/ookla-open-data You can also download the datasets from AWS Open data registry: https://registry.opendata.aws/speedtest-global-performance/ Tiles \u00b6 Hundreds of millions of Speedtests are taken on the Ookla platform each month. In order to create a manageable dataset, we aggregate raw data into tiles. The size of a data tile is defined as a function of \"zoom level\" (or \"z\"). At z=0, the size of a tile is the size of the whole world. At z=1, the tile is split in half vertically and horizontally, creating 4 tiles that cover the globe. This tile-splitting continues as zoom level increases, causing tiles to become exponentially smaller as we zoom into a given region. By this definition, tile sizes are actually some fraction of the width/height of Earth according to Web Mercator projection (EPSG:3857). As such, tile size varies slightly depending on latitude, but tile sizes can be estimated in meters. For the purposes of these layers, a zoom level of 16 (z=16) is used for the tiling. This equates to a tile that is approximately 610.8 meters by 610.8 meters at the equator (18 arcsecond blocks). The geometry of each tile is represented in WGS 84 (EPSG:4326) in the tile field. Tile Attributes \u00b6 Each tile contains the following adjoining attributes: Field Name Type Description avg_d_kbps Integer The average download speed of all tests performed in the tile, represented in kilobits per second. avg_u_kbps Integer The average upload speed of all tests performed in the tile, represented in kilobits per second. avg_lat_ms Integer The average latency of all tests performed in the tile, represented in milliseconds tests Integer The number of tests taken in the tile. devices Integer The number of unique devices contributing tests in the tile. quadkey Text The quadkey representing the tile. Quadkeys \u00b6 Quadkeys can act as a unique identifier for the tile. This can be useful for joining data spatially from multiple periods (quarters), creating coarser spatial aggregations without using geospatial functions, spatial indexing, partitioning, and an alternative for storing and deriving the tile geometry. Layers \u00b6 Two layers are distributed as separate sets of files: performance_mobile_tiles - Tiles containing tests taken from mobile devices with GPS-quality location and a cellular connection type (e.g. 4G LTE, 5G NR). performance_fixed_tiles - Tiles containing tests taken from mobile devices with GPS-quality location and a non-cellular connection type (e.g. WiFi, ethernet). Time Period and Update Frequency \u00b6 Layers are generated based on a quarter year of data (three months) and files will be updated and added on a quarterly basis. A /year=2020/quarter=1/ period, the first quarter of the year 2020, would include all data generated on or after 2020-01-01 and before 2020-04-01 . Data is subject to be reaggregated regularly in order to honor Data Subject Access Requests (DSAR) as is applicable in certain jurisdictions under laws including but not limited to General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and Lei Geral de Prote\u00e7\u00e3o de Dados (LGPD).

The effect of tile drainage on crop production, hydrology, and the environment on a regional scale is elusive due to lack of high-resolution, spatially-explicit tile drainage area information for the Contiguous United States (CONUS). We developed a 30-m resolution tile drainage map of the most-likely tile-drained area of the CONUS (AgTile-US) from county-level tile drainage census using a geospatial model that uses soil drainage information and topographic slope as inputs.

Over the heavily tile-drained midwestern regions of the U.S., the accuracy ranges from 82.7% to 93.6%.

For e.g., if a pixel value = 150, it means that the vegetation in that pixel has 1.5 Kg of water for every 1 Kg of live biomass. Live fuel moisture content was estimated from a deep learning model trained using Sentinel-1 C-band backscatter, Landsat-8 optical reflectance, and various other land surface characteristics like canopy height, soil texture, etc. Citation \u00b6 Rao, K., Williams, A.P., Flefil, J.F. & Konings, A.G.

Because areas of high population density and growth (high vulnerability) are generally associated with urban areas that have lower levels of poverty and higher degrees of adaptive capacity (low vulnerability), to some degree, the population factors cancel out the poverty and adaptive capacity indicators. To account for this, the data set includes two sub-indices, a Population Exposure Index (PEI), which only includes population density and population growth; and a Poverty and Adaptive Capacity Index (PACI), composed of subnational poverty, maternal education levels, market accessibility, and conflict.
